Bias and Variance Error

	Aim is to build generalized efficient models
		overfit --> model performs well in training datasets and underperforms in testing/validation data -- High Variance
		Generalized Model --> model which performs the same in both training and testing dataset -- Low Variance and Low Bias
		underfit --> model does not perform well in training datasets as well underperforms in testing/validation data -- High Bias
	Reduce Errors

Model Error - Misclassification or wrong prediction

Error
	Irreducible Error/Unavoidable Error
		Caused by unknown variables
	Reducible Error
		Bias
		Variance

Total Error = Bias^2 + Variance + Irreducible Error

Bias - 
	Building simple models with less influential features leads to incaccurate models
	Bias explains how far are the predicted values from the actual values
	Defines more of accuracy
	High Bias - Underfit, inaccurate, simple model
	Reason for Bias - Model could not capture the real world complexity of the data
	Example - Model -> Predicting fuel efficiency with just Speed input - 20 kmpl
		 In real world - traffic, load on your car, acceleration, your driving behaviour - 18 kmpl

Variance
	Defines more of consistency
	occurs when model performs best/good in training dataset but fails in test/Validation/prod
	High variance cause overfitting in the model - overfit, inconsistent
	Reason for Variance - More complex model

Trade Off
	Model complexity should be in such a way that made TRADE OFF Bias with Variance
		
	High Bias Low Variance --> inaccurate, consistent
	High Bias High Variance --> inaccurate, inconsistent
	Low Bias Low Variance --> accurate, consistent
	Low Bias High Variance --> somewhat accurate, inconsistent

Identification Techniques
	Bias
		High Training Error
		High Validation/Test Error

	Variance
		Low Training Error
		High Validation Error

Reducing High Bias and High Variance
	Bias
		Add more good features or polynomial featuring
		Reduce Regularization

	Variance
		Increase more training data
		Reduce input features
		Increase regularization
