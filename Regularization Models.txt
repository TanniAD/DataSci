Regularization Model

Shrinkage models

Linear Models = coeff

Cost function - SSE

Curse of Dimensionality
	Depth vs Breath analysis


Loss function = SSE

Ridge Model
	Linear Regression - SSE
	Ridge -	Coefficient

	Ridge Expression
		Linear Regression Cost Function = Sum(yactual-ypred)^2
		Ridge Expression with addl. term in cost function = Sum(yactual-ypred)^2 + lambda * sum(coefficient)^2
			lambda - penalty term --> suppress the coefficients
				when lambda is high coefficients are suppressed
				when lambda is low, eg =0, the exp is the same as Linear Regression
				lamda - select lamda in such a way that your model performs best in test and training
	After regularization, coeff may come closer to 0

Lasso Model - least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
	Lasso Expression with addl. term in cost function = Sum(yactual-ypred)^2 + lambda * sum(coefficient)
	After regularization, coeff may be 0
	y=m1X1 + m2X2 + m3X3 +C
	if m3 = 0, then y=m1X1 + m2X2 + C
